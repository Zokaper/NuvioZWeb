## Phase 10 restart (2026-10-25)

The maintainer decided on 2026-10-22 to restart the TV port from current upstream rather than merge
354 upstream commits into the 0.3.40 fork. Stage 1 lays the trunk:

- **Z tooling** carried from the archive: the `debug-v*` prerelease workflow, `upstream-drift.sh` and its
  weekly workflow, `.gitattributes` (`merge=ours` on the version files), this file, `AGENTS.md` (now
  tracked against upstream's ignore) and `docs/Z-PORT-MATRIX.md`, whose implementation rows describe the
  archive, not this line.
- **Z identity**: own Tizen package/app id and name, `-z<n>` versioning, the updater pointed at this
  fork, About naming the vanilla base. Upstream-owned files touched are listed in
  `nuvio-z/Docs/PATCH-SURFACE.md` under _NuvioZWeb_.

### Vanilla 1.2.9 on the test TV (Stage 0, maintainer-driven)

Installed with upstream's own Windows installer on the daily test set, a **2022 Samsung QA60Q60B
(Tizen 6.5, armv7)** at `192.168.100.120`. A 2024+ set (Tizen 8+) is available later; a pass on the
Q60B does not count for Tizen 8+. Maintainer's verdict: "not too bad", better than the old port.
Problems, all called minor:

1. opening the in-player source list freezes the whole UI until the list has loaded;
2. the in-player audio track list renders very small;
3. the UI feels a bit cramped - scale it down a touch.

The first install failed `118, -11 Author certificate not match` because the old Z port had shipped
upstream's package id; deleting it on the TV fixed it. That is why this line has its own id.

### Upstream's test baseline at vanilla 1.2.9

- `npm test` fails on a clean clone: it runs `tests/test-plugin-system.mjs`, and upstream gitignores
  `tests/`. Not ours.
- `npm run test:android-parity` stops at its first failure. Run individually, **20 of the 21
  `scripts/test-*.mjs` pass**; `test-tmdb-detail-parity` fails because its esbuild stub of `config.js`
  lacks five exports `serverConfigurationStore.js` now imports. Vanilla failure, not ours.
- The debug workflow runs the parity scripts as informational (`continue-on-error`).

## Getting at the TV from this PC

- `sdb` 4.2.36 (from `download.tizen.org`) is at `Nuvio Z/tv-tools/sdb-4.2.36/x/data/tools/sdb.exe`.
  `sdb connect 192.168.100.120` works **only while upstream's installer is closed** - it holds the
  TV's one developer session. `sdb shell 0 vd_applist` lists installed apps.
- `sdb shell 0 debug <appId>` (remote inspector) hung with no output on the installer-signed vanilla
  app. Untried on a WGT signed as debuggable.
- The set answers the Samsung network-remote API (`http://192.168.100.120:8001/api/v2/`); keys go
  over `wss://…:8002` after a one-time Allow on the TV. Not set up yet.
- Pictures: a DroidCam phone pointed at the TV, `http://192.168.100.70:4747/video` (MJPEG, one viewer
  at a time). `Nuvio Z/tv-tools/tvshot.py OUT.jpg` saves one frame. AVPlay video is a hardware
  plane, so only the camera sees the picture itself.

## Known follow-ups

- Upstream's `release-platform-artifacts.yml` still globs `NuvioTV001_*.wgt`; fix it at the release
  gate (Stage 8), when this line first cuts a real release.
- webOS id: still upstream's `space.nuvio.webos` (Stage 7).
